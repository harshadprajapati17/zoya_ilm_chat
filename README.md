## Key Features Explained

### AI Reply Suggestions

When a customer sends a message:
1. System searches for relevant products using vector similarity
2. AI analyzes the query and conversation context
3. Generates a contextual reply mentioning relevant products
4. Returns confidence score and related product links
5. Manager can use, edit, or ignore the suggestion

### Multi-Lingual Flow

1. Customer types in their preferred language (e.g., Hindi)
2. Message is detected and translated to English for manager
3. Manager sees both original and translated text
4. Manager replies in English
5. Reply is automatically translated to customer's language
6. Customer receives message in their language

### Product Search

The system uses vector embeddings for semantic search:
1. Customer query is converted to embedding
2. PostgreSQL pgvector finds similar products
3. Results ranked by similarity score
4. Top matches included in AI suggestions

## Customization

### Adding More Languages

Edit `lib/services/translation.ts`:

```typescript
export const SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES = {
  en: 'English',
  hi: 'Hindi',
  // Add more languages
  ta: 'Tamil',
  te: 'Telugu',
  // ...
};
```

### Changing AI Model

Edit `lib/services/openai.ts`:

```typescript
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o', // Change to gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, etc.
  // ...
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Module not found: @/app/generated/prisma
Run these commands:
```bash
npx prisma generate
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### Database connection errors
Ensure DATABASE_URL uses absolute path with three slashes:
```env
DATABASE_URL="file:///Users/sangeetha/Projects/zoya_ilm/prisma/dev.db"
```

### Translation not working
Without Google Translate API key, the system operates in fallback mode (returns original text). To enable full translation, add a valid API key to `.env`.

### AI suggestions failing
- Check your OpenAI API key is valid
- Ensure you have sufficient OpenAI credits
- Verify the key in `.env` file is correct

### Products not importing
- Verify the CSV file exists at `/Users/sangeetha/Downloads/products_rows.csv`
- Ensure the CSV format matches the expected schema
- Run with `npx tsx scripts/import-products.ts`

## Production Deployment

For production, it's recommended to:
1. **Switch to PostgreSQL** with pgvector for better performance and vector search
2. **Add proper authentication** (NextAuth.js, Auth0, etc.)
3. **Set up proper environment variables** on your hosting platform
4. **Configure rate limiting** for API endpoints
5. **Add monitoring** (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
